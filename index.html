			<h1>New York companies ignore campaign contribution limits with impunity</h1>
			<div class="byline">
				By <a href="http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/author/hstevens/">Harry Stevens</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				In February 2013, the Board of Elections sent a letter to Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore alerting her that in 2011, a construction company called Morano Brothers Corp. had broken the law.
			</p>

			<p>
				The company, the letter said, had exceed New York State’s campaign contribution limit and repeatedly ignored the board’s attempts to contact it about the over-contribution.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The Board considers the over contributions to be knowing and willful,” the letter continued, “and requests that you consider [Morano Brothers Corp] for prosecution.”
			</p>

			<p>
				But Morano Brothers, like eight other companies across New York State that were the subjects of such letters, was not prosecuted for those offenses and in recent years has continued to break the election law, <a href="http://www.elections.ny.gov/CFContributionLimits.html">which limits companies to $5,000</a> in total campaign contributions in a calendar year.
			</p>

			<p>
				"We didn't even know about this law," said Morano Brothers's comptroller, who declined to give his name. "This is a very small company. We don't have the money to contribute thousands of dollars."
			</p>

			<p>
				The company's breeches of election law have indeed been relatively minor: an extra $150 in 2012, an extra $1000 in 2013. But in a campaign finance system <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/cuomo-has-raised-millions-through-loophole-he-pledged-to-close">so fraught with loopholes</a> as to render the $5,000 corporate contribution limit nearly irrelevant, companies nevertheless flout the law with impunity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Taken together, at least 160 companies have doled out at least $350,000 in excess campaign contributions since Jan. 1, 2012, according to an analysis by the New York World.

			<p>
				Some of the companies, like Verifone and Pfizer, trade on major stock exchanges; others, like Morano Brothers, are more obscure. But the corporate scofflaws all have something in common: none have been prosecuted for their offenses, which are classified as misdemeanors under state law.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since 2012, the New York State Board of Elections, charged with enforcing the state’s election law, has not referred any corporate over-contribution cases to a district attorney for prosecution. The board used to refer such cases to district attorneys’ offices but stopped after the prosecutors failed to pursue even a single one, said board spokesperson John Conklin.
			</p>

			<p>
				Indeed, dozens of referral letters, obtained through an open records request, reveal the futility of the board’s efforts to notify district attorneys of companies in their respective jurisdictions that defied the state’s corporate contribution limits.
			</p>

			<p>
				"Not a single prosecution resulted,” Conklin said of the referral letters, adding that the “corporate over-contribution audit is a major undertaking which required a lot of staff time and effort when we had relatively few investigators and auditors.”
			</p>

			<p>
				(A New York World reporter, however, was able to identify 184 excessive contributions that have occurred since 2012 after only a few days of research.)
			</p>

			<p>
				District attorneys, for their part, are loath to prosecute such cases because of the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a company knowingly and willfully exceeded the contribution limit.
			</p>

			<p>
				“That would take a huge criminal investigation,” said Lucien Chafen, a spokesman for the Westchester County District Attorney’s office, which since 2011 has declined to prosecute 17 cases of corporate over-contributions – including that of Morano Brothers – referred by the Board of Elections.
			</p>

			<p>
				Instead, district attorneys have settled for warning the offending companies about the over-contributions and demanding they request refunds from the candidates. Some companies comply; others don’t.
			</p>

			<p>
				“In many instances, the company will go back to the campaign they contributed to and request the money over the limit back so that it is in compliance,” said Kim Livingston, a spokesperson for the Queens County District Attorney.
			</p>

			<p>
				“We've had a pretty good degree of success with this, and thus far have not had to prosecute a corporation or company in relation to exceeding campaign contributions,” Livingston added, though she declined to provide an example of a company that had asked for its money back, citing her office’s policy to not comment on past investigations.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2011, the Board of Elections sent Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas J. Spota a letter informing him that Medford-based Gabrielli Truck Sales Ltd. had exceeded the corporate contribution limit in 2009 and at least one additional time since 2006.
			</p>

			<p>
				Though the letter recommended Gabrielli Truck Sales for prosecution, no charges were brought. In 2013, the company contributed $8,200, again breaking the law with impunity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Gabrielli Trucks Sales CEO Armando Gabrielli said he was aware of the $5,000 contribution limit but did not know his company had exceeded it in 2013. He hung up before a reporter could ask whether he had heard of the Board of Election’s letter to the District Attorney, and he did not respond to a follow-up email.
			</p>

			<p>
				Political candidates can seldom be blamed for the over-contributions because single contributions rarely exceed the $5,000 limit. When they do, the excess is almost always refunded (a notable exception this year is Verifone’s $7,200 contribution to Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano, $2,200 of which has yet to be refunded).
			</p>

			<p>
				Conklin said the Board of Elections would be reinvigorating its efforts to rein in corporate over-contributors in the future. This year’s budget <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/new-independent-enforcement-unit-nys-board-elections-begins-tuesday-blog-entry-1.1923505">set aside money to create an enforcement division</a> within the Board of Elections tasked with enforcing the state’s election laws.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The Legislature and the Governor agreed that more resources were needed and they created the new enforcement division and gave them the resources we had been asking for,” Conklin said.
			</p>

			<p>
				This year, companies have made at least $89,000 worth of excessive campaign contributions. The enforcement division is yet to take action against any of them.
